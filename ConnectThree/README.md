# Description

Connect Three was the first app I had developed outside of an assignment and without following a tutorial.  The app is fairly simple; similar to connect four and tic-tac-toe, the object of game is to place three of your colored circles in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  Depending on the player's color, a song will play when victory conditions are met! 


# What I learned

While the game may seem simple, I actually learned quite a lot from creating the app.  Personally, I was most proud of figuring out how to play a song through the audio player feature.  I also learned how to programmatically change a button's image and to run a fuction when the button is tapped.  This was also the first app where I utilized the Navigation controller and created a back arrow to return to the previous view controller.

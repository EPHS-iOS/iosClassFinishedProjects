/*
BUG LIST
1. [KINDA FIXED] Invincible Eggs [Happens less now]
DESC: Probably because the egg is being removed from the egg array
and not being removed from the childnode.
CAUSE: Possibly from eliminating an egg at the same time as the tower elims one

2. [FIXED] Projectile still on screen and causing collision with other eggs [FIXED]
CAUSE: Projectile is currently only removed from screen when it has been collided.
So if the Egg the projectile is targeting was eliminated before the proj. hits, then
projectile never gets removed.

3. Some egg eliminations are not counting, therefore the level will not progress.

4. Cracked Kicking Animation broken (basicEggs) [FiXED]
DESC: If an egg is in cracked state before reaching the fence, once it reaches
the fence, instead of changing to cracked kicking animation, it changes to
normal egg kicking animation

5. Game not removing Egg sprite from parent correctly
DESC: When this happens, usually the egg is already been removed from the egg array.
However the egg for some reason is not removed form the parent correctly. This causes
The egg to still appear on the screen but not targettable, however it still was counted towards the
total egg count goal.s

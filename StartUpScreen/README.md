# Description

This start up screen was created for the Eden Prairie High School Student App and is shown each time the app is launched.  The start screen shows a simple animation of a transparent block moving to the right having the words appear as if they were loading bar.

# What I learned

Despite seeming very simple, a lot of work went into the creation of this app.  Originally, I was trying to see if there was a way to have an image gradually go from transparent to opaque along the x-axis.  However, I thought of the idea of having a transparent block move across the screen with a 3 second delay.  This gave off the same affect as I originally was hoping for and helped me learn a lot along the way.  I learned how to use animation in a single view app, segues, and how to delay actions.  My most difficult task was tryign to figure out how to select the top most view controller and present it modually.

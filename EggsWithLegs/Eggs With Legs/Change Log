Version 2.0.0 Stable

MAJOR CHANGES
* Supports all devices (doesn't make it look good, but it supports them :)
* Days are now based on a timer rather than amount of eggs cracked
* Eggs now display a health bar

MINOR CHANGES
* Added tab for statistics in the Scene after passed a day
* Egg spawning is no longer tied to an SKAction and now is based of a programmed clock that is modifiable mid round
* Loading scene added when game is launched (This is where the game calibrates the scene sizes to scale with every device)
    - Future uses of this is to add loading local data
* Win Scene now saves game data locally (Data is saved but not used for now)
* Visual improvements like backgrounds and stuff
*

# Description

The about me app was the very first assignment we were given in class.  The objective was to have four differnet buttons bring up an image symbolising an aspect of our lives.  I chose to have an image of my lizard, travel, a book I was reading, and a photo of the moon I took through a telescope. 

# What I learned

Despite my minimal programming experience, I was able to create buttons that displayed the images fairly quickly, However, my biggest challenge was figuring out how to use the auto layout feature (especially in different orientations).  Overall, I leanred what the assets folder is used for, the basics of buildign a UI, how to use buttons, and how to have the correct layout in different phone sizes and orientations.
